# perlin_noise
C++ implementation of perlin noise using SFML

Requirements: 1) C++11, 2) SFML 2.3.2

The program was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial, gcc 5.4.0.

Instructions:
1) For an out-of-place build: create a build directory (mkdir build)
2) Change directory to the created build directory (cd build)
3) Create build files with CMake in the build directory (cmake ..)
4) Build the project (e.g. for Unix makefiles it is achieved by using "make" command in the terminal)
5) Launch the executable file "perlin_noise".


Implementation of perlin noise in C++ using SFML. Algorithm can be tuned to produce variations of perlin noise (like wood texture and others).
